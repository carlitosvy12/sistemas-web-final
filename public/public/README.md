This project consists of the development of a personal portfolio created with HTML and CSS. Its main goal is to clearly and visually showcase who I am, my skills, experience, and some of my projects. To create it, I based the design on a Figma model.

In addition, the website is fully responsive, adapting correctly to different screen sizes through the use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries.

The site includes several sections:
a header with a navigation menu, a main “Hero” block with a personal introduction, an “About” section with a description and photo, a “Skills” section displaying the technologies I master, an “Experience” section, a “Projects” section with examples of work, a “Testimonials” section with client feedback, and finally, a contact block with social media links and a footer.

All the content was developed without frameworks or external libraries, using only HTML and CSS as specified in the project guidelines.

Important: Since I don’t have much professional experience yet, all project and personal information is fictional, used only to fill the design layout. In the future, as I gain more experience, I will replace it with real information.
